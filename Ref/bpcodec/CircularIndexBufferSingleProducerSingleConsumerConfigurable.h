 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This CircularIndexBufferSingleProducerSingleConsumerConfigurable class is used for:
 * 1.) one producer thread to obtain an array index into a circular buffer, modify the data,
 *     and commit the write (modifying only the end index).
 * 2.) one consumer thread to obtain an array index into a circular buffer, read the data,
 *     and commit the read (modifying only the begin index).
 * This class is only concerned with sharing the two array indices between the two threads.
 * Therefore this class requires the user to provide the array(s) of user defined data.
 * This class assumes that "unsigned int" read and write operations for an index are atomic.
